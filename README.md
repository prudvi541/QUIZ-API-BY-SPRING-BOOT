# QUIZ-API-BY-SPRING-BOOT
 Simple Quiz API with Spring Boot  This repository houses my simple quiz API built using Spring Boot and backed by a PostgreSQL database. The API allows users to create, retrieve, and manage quiz questions, categories, and difficulty levels. Itâ€™s a fun and educational project that showcases my Spring Boot skills!
